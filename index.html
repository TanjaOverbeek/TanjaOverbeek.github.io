                    Hi! I am Tanja, an Integrated Product Design student from Delft. 
                    As a designer I want to make an impact by designing for sustainability. 
                    I believe we all need to put in extra effort to preserve our beautiful planet.
                    In addition to this I am intrigued by design for children.
            
                    I always want to keep learning. My interest are widely spread, from
                    drawing and sketching to programming. I want to keep developing
                    myself and expand my knowledge, including into new fields.
            
                    I am a creative, easy-going resourceful team worker with a can-do 
                    attitude. I work best in a team and an enjoyable, motivating 
                    team atmosphere is important to me.
                </p>
